Activities track the progress of a user related to readable or watchable
resources such as light novel and graphic novel chapters, and anime episodes.

Activities are immutable and store meta information such as when the activity
started, when it ended, from where the progress started and where it stopped.

An example of activities might be a user watching on Netflix the Episode N of
the Anime XYZ from minute 5:47 to minute 15:32 on the 7th of July at 8:35 PM.

In this specific case a Chrome extension might automatically create a new
activity every minute until the user pauses the video or closes the tab.

The information collected allows the service to let the user know when was
the last "checkpoint" recorded, enabling the user to resume the episode at
the correct time on a different platform (i.e. continue from where I left).
Additionally, the information collected is useful to generate histograms and
to idenitify popular scenes within an episode (we all know Pornhub has an
identical feature already).

There is no limit to the number of activities a user might generate and some
activities are automatically registered from Animeshon itself, for example
when a user is reading a graph novel directly on our platform. Activities can
also be repeated multiple times for the same range (e.g. if a user rewatches
the same scene in an episode 5 times).

Whenever an activity is created that marks the end of a resource, its parent
tracker is updated to include it in the list of completed resource.

A tracker tracks the progress of one or more users related to releasable
resources such as animes, graphic novels, light novels, and visual novels.

It is important to notice that users cannot `watch` an anime from a technical
perspective but rather they can watch one of its releases such as its pysical
DVD copy or its broadcast on Funimation. Nevertheless, for a better user
experience a releasable content is considered completed whenever a user
watched, played, or read all of its "regular" episodes, chapters, or
releases. This means that "recaps" and "specials" are ultimately ignored.

Animes and novels are easier to track as they have a countable and defined
amount of resources that can be consumed (episodes and chapters). Their
progress is therefore automatically updated whenever a new user activity is
generated.

Visual novels and video games in general do not always have a clear progress
and therefore must be updated manually by the user.

A tracker accounts only for the overall progress on a releasable content,
this means that it won't provide any information about rewatches.

Additionally, trackers can be shared among multiple users thorough audiences,
this is useful whenever a user is, for example, watching an anime together
with a group of friends and wants to keep track of the progress separately
from his/her own personal progress or from the progress on the same resource
with another group of friends (i.e. audience).

The progress of audience trackers affects the personal progress, that is
whenever new resources are consumed by an audience the personal tracker of
each member belonging to that audience will be updated automatically as well.
This behavior makes sense as a group of people  watching the Episode N of the
Anime XYZ also means that each member of the group also watched the episode
and therefore their collective personal progress changed.
